 * sky - the aircraft around home. no network here: the firmware fetches the JSON and hands it
 * to sky_read piece by piece as it comes in, the PC preview makes it up. two formats:
 *   ADS-B Exchange v2   {"ac":[{"hex":..,"flight":..,"lat":..,"lon":..,"alt_baro":..}, ..]}
 *                       spoken by the free networks. adsb.fi's old v2 called the list "aircraft"
 *   Flightradar24 API   {"data":[{"hex":..,"callsign":..,"lat":..,"lon":..,"alt":..}, ..]}
 *                       paid, with a key, adds where the flight comes from and goes to
 * the list keeps the nearest SKY_MAX, merges every answer into what it had (so each plane keeps
 * its trail) and forgets a plane a while after the server stops mentioning it.
